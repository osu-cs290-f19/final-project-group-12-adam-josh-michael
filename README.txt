Function that analyses if the clicked button is a battleship or not. Check if each button has the "battleship" class or not.

When page loads, have the user select what difficulty they want. This will appear on the game screen

In the 2d array that stores where all battleships are, we have a big array of 0 and if there is a ship that is size one then there is a 1 for a ship of size 2 there will be two 2's and size 3 ect. When a ship is hit we change the array index to an x. If there for example no more 3's in the array, we know the ship of size 3 was sunk
